This is a hack for the auto_complete_for plugin and has to be installed beside auto_complete_for plugin

Example:

  # Controller
  class BlogController < ApplicationController
    auto_complete_with_scope_for 'published', :post, :title
  end

  # or with multiple scopes
  class BlogController < ApplicationController
    auto_complete_with_scope_for 'published.recent', :post, :title
  end

By default, auto_complete_for limits the results to 10 entries,
and sorts by the given field.

auto_complete_with_scope_for takes a third parameter, an options hash to
the find method used to search for the records:

  auto_complete_with_scope_for 'published', :post, :title, :limit => 15, :order => 'created_at DESC'
